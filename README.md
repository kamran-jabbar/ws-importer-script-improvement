# ws-importer-script-improvement
# Configuration
1. Follow the same steps as in assignment README.
2. Place the `WsImporter.php` to `/code/src/` directory. 
3. Execute `php /code/src/WsImporter.php` in Docker bash.


# Improvments
1. Conversion of custom PHP script to OOP(class, functions, constructor, etc).
2. Generic query function to handle queries dynamically. It improves reusability. 
3. XML parser function. 
4. Removal of extra unused variables. 
5. Exception Handling.
6. XML and PDO loading using constructor and their getters. 
7. Divide lengthy code to smaller functions for better reusability, maintainability, and unit testing. 
8. Give code infrastructure to implement the logger(part of todo).
9. Add PHPdoc and function description so that it is understandable for other devs.
